**Data Cleansing**
A truly thorough data cleanse, following these basic steps:
1. Remove duplicate or irrelevant observations.
2. Fix structural errors.
3. Filter unwanted outliers.
4. Handle missing data.
5. Validate and QA.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions. It can help identify obvious errors, as well as better understand patterns within the data, detect outliers or anomalous events, find interesting relations among the variables.

**Project Based Analytics**
This is the use of past and current project data to enable effective decisions on project delivery. This includes: Descriptive analytics presenting data in the most effective format. Predictive analytics using past data to predict future performance.

   1. Superstore Sales Analysis

      This case is an example of a Superstore Dataset, a type of simulation in which I perform extensive data analysis to provide insight into how a company can increase its profits while minimizing losses.

   2. Olist Customer Segmentation

      This case is an example of the Olist E-Commerce Dataset, a type of simulation in which I perform extensive data analysis to provide insight into customer groups based on their behavior, so that companies can find marketing strategies based on their respective types or characteristics.

   3. Travel Insurance

      This case is an example of a Travel Insurance Dataset, a type of simulation in which I conduct extensive data analysis to provide insight to companies in discovering what criteria might be determining factors for someone to make an insurance claim.
