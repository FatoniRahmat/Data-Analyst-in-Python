**Project Based Analytics**

   1. Superstore Sales Analysis

      This case is an example of a Superstore Dataset, a type of simulation in which I perform extensive data analysis to provide insight into how a company can increase its profits while minimizing losses.

   2. Olist Customer Segmentation

      This case is an example of the Olist E-Commerce Dataset, a type of simulation in which I perform extensive data analysis to provide insight into customer groups based on their behavior, so that companies can find marketing strategies based on their respective types or characteristics.
